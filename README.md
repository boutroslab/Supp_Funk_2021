## Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: middle;">
Ageing is a continuous process that causes functional decline over time and makes the body vulnerable to diseases. A central question in ageing research is the contribution of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the ageing process.
To address this question in the intestine, we employed a combinatorial approach of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq from freshly isolated in vivo intestinal epithelial cells and ex vivo cultured intestinal organoids from young and aged mice. 
This approach identified that intra-cellular expression changes underlie intestinal inflammaging, which is most distinct in enterocytes. Remarkably, ex vivo intestinal organoids recapitulate the in vivo inflammaging phenotype in culture, accompanied by changes of chromatin states. In a tissue context, the aged intestine shows features of elevated immune tolerance, which could oppose the inflammation phenotype.
In summary, our data disentangle the inflammaging phenotype on a cellular level and identify epithelial-intrinsic inflammaging, which is enabled by a permissive environment on the chromatin level.

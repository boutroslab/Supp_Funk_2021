## Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: middle;">
With age, tissues experience functional decline by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic ageing factors. The epithelium of the intestine forms a dynamic interface with its microenvironment and is exposed to various signals affecting its homeostasis. However, it remains largely unknown how ageing signatures are established and maintained in cells of the intestinal epithelium. To advance our understanding of epithelium-intrinsic age effects, we compared ageing-dependent changes in transcriptional profiles of in vivo epithelial cells and ex vivo cultured intestinal organoids. At a single cell level, we show in vivo that ageing-associated inflammation is marked by upregulation of MHC class II in all cell types of the intestine, while most pronounced in enterocytes. Ex vivo intestinal organoids largely maintain the in vivo inflammaging phenotype and revealed increased chromatin accessibility in inflammation-associated loci upon ageing. In the microenvironment of the aged intestine, we found elevated levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 indicative for dysregulation of immunological homeostasis upon ageing. In summary, we identify epithelium-intrinsic inflammation in the ageing intestine that persists ex vivo. Our results provide evidence for a role of epithelial cells in propagating systemic inflammation during ageing.
